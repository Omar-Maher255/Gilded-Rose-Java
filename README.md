# Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata
__UPDATE:__
This is a fork of Emily Bache's version of The Gilded Rose Kata in Java. Her repo [can be found here](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata). I wanted to provide team's I coach two use cases without relying on the texttest library (as it's another depdency to configure). There are two tags for the two use cases for this kata.

1. __no-tests__ tag - this longer kata requires writing characterization (or microtests) for the functionality before refactoring the GildedRose 
2. A set of passing tests - with passing tests this shorter kata can focus on just refactoring the code


## Instructions
1. Build the project
2. Run the microtests
3. Follow the instructions in [GildedRoseRequirements.txt](./GildedRoseRequirements.txt)
